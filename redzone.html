          Tripwire was made for an innovation competition in 2023 by Josh, Julien, Christopher, and Lane. Tripwire ended up winning the school side of the competition and compeated at districts, where it lost but we were proud of our work.
          In Mid 2025, glitch.com the hosting service Tripwire originally used and was programmed on was shutdown. The site has been archived with all its orginal code (in its unfinished and jaded state) and is no longer being updated. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/i-suck-at-most-stuff/tripwire-backup">GitHub</a> and moved here for archival purposes. The Tripwire team is still active, just working on seperate projects now.

    <h3>What Is <font color="#f52f18">Redzone</font>?</h3>
    <p>
      <font color="#f52f18">Redzone </font> is an innovative app designed by the
      Tripwire team to provide people with valuable insights into the most
      crime-ridden parts of large cities. This app allows users to identify
      high-crime areas in their city, making it easier to avoid these areas and
      stay safe.<br /><br />

      The <font color="#f52f18">Redzone</font> app is designed with a
      user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate and customize to
      suit your specific needs. The app provides an accurate and up-to-date map
      of the city, with color-coded areas indicating crime hotspots, such as
      areas with high incidences of theft, burglary, assault, and drug-related
      offenses. Users can zoom in or out of the map to see specific
      neighborhoods or different parts of the city in detail.<br /><br />

      One of the unique features of the
      <font color="#f52f18">Redzone </font> app is that it incorporates
      algorithms to provide more precise information about the likelihood of
      crime occurring in a particular area. These algorithms analyze crime data
      from local police departments, traffic patterns, and even weather
      conditions to predict when and where crimes are most likely to occur.<br /><br />

      Using <font color="#f52f18">Redzone</font>, you can easily plan safer
      routes to your destination or avoid high-risk areas altogether. For those
      who are new to a city, <font color="#f52f18">Redzone </font>can also
      provide a valuable tool for exploring the city safely, with its
      information about potentially dangerous areas, its map, and real-time
      analysis.<br /><br />

      In summary, <font color="#f52f18">Redzone </font>is a powerful tool that
      can help you stay informed about the most crime-ridden areas of big
      cities, ensuring that you can make more informed decisions about your
      safety. It is an app that is highly recommended for those who are
      concerned about their safety or want to explore a city with an extra layer
      of security and information.<br /><br />

    <h3>When Will <font color="#f52f18">Redzone </font>Come Out?</h3>
    <p>
      Team Tripwire is currently working hard to make a first functional demo,
      including all of Jacksonville, Fl. It will take time as Jacksonville is a
      big city, and our team is compiling all the data we know about crime in
      the city.
