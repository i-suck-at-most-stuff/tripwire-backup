    <h3>What Is Tripwire?</h3>
    <p>
      Tripwire is a powerful and innovative app that provides users with the
      ability to detect criminals and sex offenders in their local area. Through
      a user-friendly interface, tripwire gives you all the information you need
      to make informed decisions about your safety. You can easily view an
      offender's photo, address, and crime history.

    <h3>Where Does Tripwire Get Its Information?</h3>

    <p>
      Tripwire gets it information from
      <a href="https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/coflyer/default.asp"
        >FDLE's Offender Search</a
      >
      and the
      <a href="https://www.nsopw.gov/">National Sex Offender Registry (NSOPW)</a
      >. We also get our info from

    <h3>Why is Tripwire Currently a Demo?</h3>
    <p>
      Tripwire is currently a demo as it only covers some areas of St.
      Augustine, St. Johns and the 32092 and 32259 zip codes. In the future we
      will have functionality across the entire state of Florida, and could
      expand to more parts of the U.S. based on the legal restrictions in said
      areas. We also would love to add an alert system and a discussion post
      page. Expanding or making a new map service and algorithm to automatically
      put in offenders info, instead of putting it in manually like it is now.
    </p>
