        <strong>Update:</strong>
        <span>
          Tripwire was made for an innovation competition in 2023 by Josh, Julien, Christopher, and Lane. Tripwire ended up winning the school side of the competition and compeated at districts, where it lost but we were proud of our work.
          In Mid 2025, glitch.com the hosting service Tripwire originally used and was programmed on was shutdown. The site has been archived with all its orginal code (in its unfinished and jaded state) and is no longer being updated. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/i-suck-at-most-stuff/tripwire-backup">GitHub</a> and moved here for archival purposes. The Tripwire team is still active, just working on seperate projects now.

    <h3>What Is Tripwire?</h3>
    <p>
      Tripwire is a powerful and innovative app that provides users with the
      ability to detect criminals and sex offenders in their local area. Through
      a user-friendly interface, tripwire gives you all the information you need
      to make informed decisions about your safety. You can easily view an
      offender's photo, address, and crime history.
    </p>

    <h3>Where Does Tripwire Get Its Information?</h3>

    <p>
      Tripwire gets it information from
      <a href="https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/coflyer/default.asp"
        >FDLE's Offender Search</a
      >
      and the
      <a href="https://www.nsopw.gov/">National Sex Offender Registry (NSOPW)</a
      >. We also get our info from

    <h3>Why is Tripwire Currently a Demo?</h3>
    <p>
      Tripwire is currently a demo as it only covers some areas of St.
      Augustine, St. Johns and the 32092 and 32259 zip codes. In the future we
      will have functionality across the entire state of Florida, and could
      expand to more parts of the U.S. based on the legal restrictions in said
      areas. We also would love to add an alert system and a discussion post
      page. Expanding or making a new map service and algorithm to automatically
      put in offenders info, instead of putting it in manually like it is now.
    </p>
