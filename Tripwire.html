          Tripwire was made for an innovation competition in 2023 by Josh, Julien, Christopher, and Lane. Tripwire ended up winning the school side of the competition and compeated at districts, where it lost but we were proud of our work.
          In Mid 2025, glitch.com the hosting service Tripwire originally used and was programmed on was shutdown. The site has been archived with all its orginal code (in its unfinished and jaded state) and is no longer being updated. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/i-suck-at-most-stuff/tripwire-backup">GitHub</a> and moved here for archival purposes. The Tripwire team is still active, just working on seperate projects now.
