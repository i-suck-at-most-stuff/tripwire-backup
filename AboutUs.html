          Tripwire was made for an innovation competition in 2023 by Josh, Julien, Christopher, and Lane. Tripwire ended up winning the school side of the competition and compeated at districts, where it lost but we were proud of our work.
          In Mid 2025, glitch.com the hosting service Tripwire originally used and was programmed on was shutdown. The site has been archived with all its orginal code (in its unfinished and jaded state) and is no longer being updated. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/i-suck-at-most-stuff/tripwire-backup">GitHub</a> and moved here for archival purposes. The Tripwire team is still active, just working on seperate projects now.

    <h3>Who Are We?</h3>
    <p>
      The team of developers behind Tripwire consists of Christopher Li, Joshua
      Worthington, Julien Rodriguez, and Lane Smith. These talented individuals
      have collectively designed and created a revolutionary app with the
      primary objective of combating the problem of not knowing how safe you
      really are. <br /><br />
      Throughout the project, Christopher Li played a key role in fostering open
      communication and collaboration between different parts of the team. He
      helped to bridge the gap between the technical and non-technical members
      of the group, ensuring that everyone had a clear understanding of the
      app's functionality and goals. This contributed to a more cohesive and
      efficient development process, helping the team to stay on track and
      deliver a successful product.<br /><br />
      Joshua Worthington is a software engineer with a dream for developing
      solutions that make a positive impact on society. With a passion in web
      development and a strong sense of justice, he took the lead in coding the
      Tripwire interface and spearheaded its design and functionality. He worked
      closely with the rest of the Tripwire team, including Julien Rodriguez and
      Lane Smith, to ensure that the website and app were integrated seamlessly,
      providing a consistent user experience across all devices.<br /><br />
      Julien Rodriguez was a key member of the Tripwire team, responsible for
      analyzing data and identifying potential offenders in the area. Scanning
      though an abundance of websites with information, he narrowed down all the
      offenders in the 32092 and 32259 zip codes. Julien was a critical member
      of the team and the success of Tripwire.<br /><br />
      Lane Smith played an essential role in the Tripwire project as a backup
      researcher to Julien Rodriguez. Lane worked closely with the rest of the
      Tripwire team to provide additional support to Julien in analyzing data
      and identifying potential offenders in the area. In this role, Lane was
      responsible for conducting in-depth research into multiple different
      databases.<br /><br />
      Together, this talented team dedicated countless hours and resources to
      create Tripwire, a groundbreaking offender tracking application that
      combines cutting-edge technology and the motivation for making the world a
      safer place. By combining innovation, dedication, and expertise, they have
      created a powerful platform for improving the safety and security of
      communities everywhere.<br /><br />
